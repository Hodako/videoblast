# Vercel Environment Variable Instructions

When deploying the frontend of this application to Vercel, you need to configure the following environment variable in your project's settings.

Go to your Project -> Settings -> Environment Variables.

## 1. API Connection (Required)

This variable is essential for your Next.js frontend to connect to your separately deployed backend server.

-   **Variable Name:** `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`
-   **Value:** The full public URL of your deployed backend server (e.g., from Render.com). This should be the base URL for your API.

Example Value: `https://your-backend-service.onrender.com/api`


## 2. Base URL (Optional but Recommended)

This variable helps the application generate correct absolute URLs for SEO purposes (like in `sitemap.xml`) and for Open Graph (social media) link previews.

-   **Variable Name:** `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL`
-   **Value:** The full URL of your production frontend deployment on Vercel.

Example Value: `https://nosutube-project.vercel.app`
